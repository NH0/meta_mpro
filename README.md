# Meta MPRO
To execute the code, first install the dependancies.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
Then chose the instances to run by changing the `NAME` variable in main.py.  
To set the parameters, change `K` and the `Indice_R_capt_R_com` (based on the array `RS`).  
Then launch ```python main.py```  
It will save the results in logs.txt.  

By default it will display the solutions before and after the metaheuristic. It can be disabled by setting `plot_solution=False` in the call line 67 in main.py.
